# Mission-Control-Operator-Login
Overview
Security of the system is critical for the UAT Space Program.  A new request has been made by the Director of Security and Safety to have the User enter their first and last name before the program begins.  You need to take the first and last name as input, then display this on the screen as a concatenation of first and last names.  Make sure there is a space between the names. 

You can do this by adding a string with a space to the first name or by a double concatenation.  The maximum number of characters for the concatenated name cannot be more than 20.  If it is more than 20, the user should be given a warning to re-enter.  The program should not move on until this condition is met (hint – loop).

Next, the user must enter their badge number.  This should be a number with 3 or fewer digits.  You are required to validate that it is a number and has 3 or fewer digits (hint <1000). The program should not move on until this condition is met (hint – loop).

Objectives:
String manipulations
User input validation
Requirements:
Inputs for User first and last name
Check if the string is great than >20 characters and give a warning – but do not continue the program if invalid
Inputs for User badge number
Check if badge number is valid and 3 digits– but do not continue the program if invalid
Have at least 1 creative element – images, fonts, background color, etc. 
Create a nice look and feel for the user and make a great user experience!
Comment above almost every line of your code, both HTML and JavaScript!
Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
Take one or more screen prints of your application running.
PRO TIPS:
Put all input boxes and buttons inside the one form tag.
On the form, you should have all your input boxes, but only one submit button so the user will submit all the input boxes all at once. Your JavaScript should start validating them all at once when the user presses submit. 
Deliverable:
Submit GitHub repo address.
Submit a print screen of your application running.
